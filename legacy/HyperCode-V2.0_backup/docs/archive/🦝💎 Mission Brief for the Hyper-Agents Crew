# 🦝💎 Mission Brief for the Hyper-Agents Crew

## The Idea (30 seconds)

**What**: Port your 8 agents from TypeScript → OpenClaw SOUL.md format  
**Why**: OpenClaw gives you portable, LLM-agnostic agents with persistent memory and better orchestration  
**Result**: Your crew runs on any LLM (Claude, GPT, local models) with zero code changes

## Why This Matters for YOUR Crew

**Current state**: Your agents live in TypeScript, locked to specific API calls  
**OpenClaw upgrade**: Each agent becomes a SOUL.md file that any LLM can read and embody

**Translation**:
- Your `orchestrator.ts` → `orchestrator/SOUL.md` (portable personality file)
- Your agent prompts → Core Truths + Vibe sections
- Your TypeScript services → Reusable skills that any agent can call

## Best Way to Try: 3-Agent Test Mission

### Phase 1: Pick Your Starting Crew (5 min)

Start with your **3 stable agents**:
- **Orchestrator** - Task breakdown and coordination
- **Researcher** - Gather info fast
- **Coder** - Write tested code

Leave the others (designer, integrator, safety, etc.) for Phase 2 once we prove the concept.

### Phase 2: Convert to OpenClaw (15 min)

**For each agent, create**:

```
agents/
├── orchestrator/
│   ├── SOUL.md          # Personality from your ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT
│   ├── IDENTITY.md      # Public profile
│   └── skills/
│       └── task-decompose/
│           └── SKILL.md # Your task breakdown logic
├── researcher/
│   ├── SOUL.md          # From RESEARCHER_PROMPT
│   └── skills/
│       └── web-search/
└── coder/
    ├── SOUL.md          # From CODER_PROMPT
    └── skills/
        └── code-gen/
```

**I can generate these files for you right now** — just say "Generate the 3 SOUL.md files."

### Phase 3: Run Test Mission (10 min)

**Mission**: "Build a dyslexia-friendly button component in HyperCode"

**Expected flow**:
1. **Orchestrator** breaks it into:
   - Task 1: Research dyslexia UX patterns (Researcher)
   - Task 2: Write HyperCode button code (Coder)
2. **Researcher** returns design principles with citations
3. **Coder** generates button component with tests
4. **Orchestrator** synthesizes final output

**Success metric**: All 3 agents respond in character, complete their tasks, and the button code is usable.

### Phase 4: Validate (5 min)

**Check these**:
- ✅ Each agent stayed in character (checked SOUL.md personality)
- ✅ Orchestrator assigned tasks correctly
- ✅ Researcher cited sources
- ✅ Coder included tests
- ✅ Final output is coherent

## Quick Start Commands

### Option A: I Generate Everything
**You say**: "Generate SOUL.md files for orchestrator, researcher, coder"  
**I do**: Create 3 complete agent folders with SOUL.md + IDENTITY.md + skills  
**You do**: Copy-paste into your repo, run test mission

### Option B: You Convert One Agent
**You pick**: One agent (start with researcher — simplest)  
**I show**: Step-by-step conversion of RESEARCHER_PROMPT → SOUL.md  
**You learn**: The pattern, then convert the other 7 yourself

### Option C: Live Test First
**You give me**: A test mission ("Research ADHD-friendly color schemes")  
**I simulate**: How your researcher agent would respond in OpenClaw format  
**You see**: The difference between current TypeScript vs OpenClaw output

## The BROski Advantage

**Your repo already has**:
- Agent roles defined ✅
- Output formats specified ✅
- Task decomposition logic ✅
- Parallel execution support ✅

**We just need to**:
- Extract prompts → SOUL.md files (10 min)
- Wrap services → skills/ folders (15 min)
- Test with one mission (10 min)

**Total time**: ~35 minutes to get 3 agents running in OpenClaw format.

## What Should We Do First?

**Pick one, BROski**:

🅰️ **"Generate the 3 SOUL.md files"** → I create orchestrator, researcher, coder in OpenClaw format  

🅱️ **"Show me a test mission simulation"** → I demonstrate how your crew would handle a real task  

🅲 **"Convert researcher step-by-step"** → I teach you the pattern so you can convert all 8  

🅳 **"Just tell me what to copy-paste"** → I give you ready-to-run files for your repo
