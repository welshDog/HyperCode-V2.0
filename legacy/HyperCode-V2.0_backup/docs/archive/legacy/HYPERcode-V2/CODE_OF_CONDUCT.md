HyperCode is a **neurodivergent-first community**. We are committed to creating an environment where:

## 🎩 Our Values

### **1. Inclusion**
We actively welcome neurodivergent developers. We recognize ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and all forms of neurodivergence as valid and valuable ways of thinking.

### **2. Accessibility**
We believe accessibility is not optional. We:
- Provide visual alternatives
- Support text-to-speech
- Use clear, literal language
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Provide multiple ways to contribute

### **3. Kindness**
We are kind to ourselves and each other. We:
- Assume good intent
- Give second chances
- Celebrate small wins
- Support people struggling
- Respect boundaries

### **4. Honesty**
We communicate clearly and directly:
- Say what we mean
- No hidden meanings
- Be honest about limitations
- Ask clarifying questions
- Admit mistakes

### **5. Growth**
We learn together:
- From each other
- From failures
- From feedback
- From different perspectives
- Without shame

## 🚀 Expected Behavior

### **DO:**

✅ **Be respectful** — Of time, boundaries, and differences

✅ **Be clear** — Say what you mean, literally

✅ **Be kind** — Especially when frustrated

✅ **Ask for help** — It's strength, not weakness

✅ **Give help** — When you can, without judgment

✅ **Celebrate others** — Genuinely and publicly

✅ **Admit mistakes** — And learn from them

✅ **Be patient** — With yourself and others

✅ **Set boundaries** — And respect others' boundaries

✅ **Ask before help** — Don't assume what someone needs

### **DON'T:**

❌ **Gatekeeping** — Don't tell people they "belong" based on level/knowledge

❌ **Condescension** — Treat everyone with equal respect

❌ **Ableism** — Don't assume neurotypical = normal/better

❌ **Harassment** — No bullying, insults, or targeting

❌ **Discrimination** — No bias based on neurodivergence, identity, background

❌ **Spam** — Respect community spaces

❌ **Assume** — Ask instead of assuming needs/abilities

❌ **Forced Help** — Don't "fix" people without consent

❌ **Tone Policing** — Don't criticize how someone says things

❌ **Silence** — Speak up if something's wrong

## 💖 Specific to Neurodivergent Folks

### **Stimming is OK**
Stimming, fidgeting, pacing, vocal stims—it's all valid and welcome. Do your thing.

### **Masking is Exhausting**
You don't have to mask here. Be yourself.

### **Hyperfocus is a Superpower**
We celebrate hyperfocus and the amazing things it produces.

### **Bad Days Happen**
Some days are harder. That's normal. Take what you need.

### **Communication Differences are Valid**
- Direct isn't rude
- Literal isn't cold
- Blunt isn't mean
- Taking time to respond is okay

### **Sensory Needs Matter**
If our community spaces (Discord, etc.) are overwhelming:
- Let us know
- We'll adapt
- Your wellbeing > comfort of others

### **ADHD Tax is Real**
Forgetting to respond, late responses, missed deadlines—we understand. It's not personal.

## 😣 Reporting Issues

### **If Something Is Wrong:**

1. **Take care of yourself first**

   - Tell a trusted community member

4. **We will respond**
   - Within 48 hours (we try faster)
   - With seriousness and care
   - Confidentially
   - With action

### **What Happens Next:**

- **Action** — We may:
  - Ask for an apology

We're human. We make mistakes. If you:

## 🚀 Bottom Line

HyperCode is built **by people who think differently**.

We make space for:

**If you're neurodivergent:**
You're home here. You belong. Your brain is not broken. Your way of thinking is powerful.

Learn from us. Grow with us. Help us build something better.

**We're all here to code, learn, and create together.**
