I will implement the requested Trae Skills structure in the project root (`C:\Users\lyndz\Downloads\My Hyper Agents`), ensuring it is outside the `Configuration_Kit` folder as requested.

## 1. Directory Structure Setup
I will create the following nested directories under `.trae/skills/`:
- `generate-unit-tests/`
- `generate-api-docs/`
- `security-audit/`
- `refactor-performance/`

## 2. File Creation (SKILL.md)
I will create a `SKILL.md` file in each of the above directories, populating them with the **exact content** generated in the previous step (Turn 6), including:
- **Front-matter metadata** (`name`, `description`)
- **Description** section
- **When to use** section
- **Instructions** (step-by-step)
- **Examples** (input/output)

### Specific Files:
1.  **`generate-unit-tests/SKILL.md`**: Instructions for Jest/Vitest suite generation.
2.  **`generate-api-docs/SKILL.md`**: Instructions for OpenAPI/Markdown doc generation.
3.  **`security-audit/SKILL.md`**: Instructions for vulnerability scanning and patching.
4.  **`refactor-performance/SKILL.md`**: Instructions for complexity analysis and optimization.

## 3. Verification
- I will verify the file tree structure using `ls`.
- I will confirm that the files are correctly placed in `.trae/skills` and not in `Configuration_Kit`.
