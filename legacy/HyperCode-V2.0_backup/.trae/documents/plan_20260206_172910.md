I will implement the **HyperCode Design Template** across both `hyperflow-editor` and `broski-terminal` to ensure a unified "Cyberpunk/Hacker" aesthetic. Since neither project currently uses a CSS framework like Tailwind, I will implement a lightweight, variable-based CSS design system derived directly from your template.

### **Phase 1: Hyperflow Editor (Vite + React)**
1.  **Create Design System CSS:**
    *   Create `src/styles/hypercode.css` containing the root variables (Neon Purple/Cyan palette), global resets, and utility classes (`.panel`, `.code-rain`, `.stat-box`).
    *   Import this file in `src/main.tsx` to apply it globally.
2.  **Implement Visual Components:**
    *   **`CodeRain.tsx`:** Create a performance-optimized (Canvas-based) "Matrix-style" background component.
    *   **`HyperLayout.tsx`:** Create a wrapper component that implements the "Dashboard" look (Header + Grid Container).
3.  **Refactor Main Interface:**
    *   Update `src/App.tsx` to replace the current inline styles with the new `.panel` and layout classes.
    *   Style the Monaco Editor container to blend with the dark theme.
    *   Update the `StatusBar` and `VoiceButton` to match the new neon aesthetic.

### **Phase 2: Broski Terminal (Next.js)**
1.  **Port Design System:**
    *   Create `app/styles/hypercode.css` (mirroring the editor's styles for consistency).
    *   Import it in `app/layout.tsx`.
2.  **Integrate Layout:**
    *   Copy the `CodeRain` component to `app/components/CodeRain.tsx`.
    *   Update `app/layout.tsx` to include the `CodeRain` background and the standard "SYSTEM INITIALIZED" header.
3.  **Update Pages:**
    *   Refactor `app/page.tsx` to use the grid layout and `.panel` styling for its content blocks.

### **Phase 3: Verification**
1.  **Build Check:** Run build commands for both projects to ensure all new components and styles are valid.
2.  **Consistency Check:** Verify that CSS variables match exactly between the two projects to guarantee seamless visual transition.
