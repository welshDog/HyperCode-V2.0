I have analyzed the prioritized tasks and located the relevant files.

**1. Fix JWT Secret Check (Critical Security Fix)**
*   **Target**: `HyperCode-V2.0/THE HYPERCODE/hypercode-core/app/core/config.py` & `main.py`
*   **Action**:
    *   Update `Settings` in `config.py` to include `HYPERCODE_JWT_SECRET`.
    *   Update `main.py` to assert that `HYPERCODE_JWT_SECRET` is present on startup. If missing, the application will fail to start (raising `RuntimeError`), preventing insecure deployments.

**2. Add Support Hub Crisis Message**
*   **Target**: `HyperCode-V2.0/BROski Business Agents/broski-terminal/app/support/react/page.tsx`
*   **Action**: Insert a "SAVE HYPERCODE" crisis banner at the top of the Support Hub page, following the user's specific messaging requirements.

**3. Verify Build**
*   **Target**: `HyperCode-V2.0/BROski Business Agents/broski-terminal`
*   **Action**: Run `npm run build` to ensure the changes are valid and the project is ready for Vercel deployment.

I will proceed with these changes immediately.
