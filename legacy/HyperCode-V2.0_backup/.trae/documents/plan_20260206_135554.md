I have diagnosed the image size issue and created a remediation plan.

**Findings:**

1. **Build Context is Massive:** The diagnostic command revealed that `data/ollama/models/blobs` contains over **8GB** of files, and `data/pg15` (Postgres data) is also being included.
2. **Files to Ignore:**

   * `data/` (Contains Ollama models and DB data) - **Critical**

   * `.venv/` (Virtual environment)

   * `.git/` (Version control history)

   * `__pycache__/`

**Plan:**

1. **Create .dockerignore:** I will create a `.dockerignore` file in `HyperCode-V2.0/THE HYPERCODE/hypercode-core/` to exclude these directories from the build context.
