I have moved the Docker fix review to `docs/health-reports/DOCKER_HEALTH_REVIEW_2026-02-06.md`.

Based on the expert review, I have a plan to address the critical Docker issues:

**1. Immediate Resource Action (USER REQUIRED):**
*   **Action:** You need to manually increase your Docker Desktop resource allocation.
*   **Target:** **4 CPUs** and **8 GB RAM** (Minimum).
*   **How:** Open Docker Desktop -> Settings -> Resources. This cannot be done by me programmatically.

**2. Image Optimization (My Task):**
*   **Goal:** Reduce `hypercode-core` from 16.3GB to <2GB.
*   **Strategy:** Implement a **Multi-Stage Build** in the `hypercode-core` Dockerfile.
    *   *Stage 1 (Builder):* Install GCC, build-essential, compile dependencies.
    *   *Stage 2 (Runtime):* Copy only compiled artifacts/wheels to a slim Python image.
*   **Benefit:** Removes gigabytes of build tools and cache from the production image.

**3. Llama Stabilization (My Task):**
*   **Action:** Add resource limits to `hypercode-llama` in `docker-compose.yml` to prioritize it (give it a "reservation" of RAM).
*   **Backup Plan:** If you cannot upgrade RAM, I can comment out the local Llama service and switch the configuration to use an external API (Claude/OpenAI) as recommended.

**Verification Plan:**
*   After you adjust Docker Desktop settings and I optimize the image:
*   Run `docker stats` to confirm memory pressure has dropped.
*   Run `docker images` to verify the size reduction of `hypercode-core`.

**Proposal:**
Shall I proceed with **refactoring the `hypercode-core` Dockerfile** to use a multi-stage build immediately? This will solve the disk usage and download time issues.
