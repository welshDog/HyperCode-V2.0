I will generate a complete **Hyperfocus Configuration Kit** containing all the necessary prompt engineering and settings for your 8-agent crew.

### **Phase 1: The Agent Configuration Vault**
I will create a folder `Configuration_Kit` and generate highly-tuned system prompts for all 8 agents. Each file will contain the specific **Role**, **Context**, and **Behavior** text you need to copy-paste into Trae.

**Tier 1: Core Builders**
1.  `01_Frontend_Specialist.md`: React/UI focused, visual reasoning prompts.
2.  `02_Backend_Specialist.md`: API/Architecture focused, robust logic prompts.
3.  `03_Database_Architect.md`: Schema/Optimization focused.

**Tier 2: Support Crew**
4.  `04_QA_Engineer.md`: Test generation and validation protocols.
5.  `05_DevOps_Engineer.md`: CI/CD and infrastructure definitions.
6.  `06_Security_Engineer.md`: OWASP and vulnerability scanning rules.

**Tier 3: Leadership**
7.  `07_System_Architect.md`: High-level design and conflict resolution prompts.
8.  `08_Project_Strategist.md`: Task breakdown and timeline management prompts.

### **Phase 2: The Hive Mind (Memory & Skills)**
I will generate the shared intelligence files:
1.  `Team_Memory_Standards.md`: The "Source of Truth" template containing coding standards, tech stack rules, and definition of done (to be pasted into Settings > Memories).
2.  `Agent_Skills_Library.md`: The specific prompt templates for your custom skills (e.g., "Generate Unit Tests", "Security Audit") to be pasted into Settings > Skills.

### **Phase 3: Launch Guide**
1.  `README_Setup_Guide.md`: A quick checklist on how to apply these configurations in Trae to get your crew running in minutes.
