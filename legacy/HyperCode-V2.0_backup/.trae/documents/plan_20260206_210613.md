I have analyzed the current system state against your Go-Live Checklist. The system is functional but requires specific "Hardening" steps to be considered production-ready.

### **1. Environment Hardening (Configuration)**
- **Secure Secrets**: The current `docker-compose.yml` has empty `API_KEY` and missing `HYPERCODE_JWT_SECRET`. I will generate secure, random 32+ character keys for these.
- **Production Mode**: Switch `ENVIRONMENT` from `development` to `production` in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Database Consistency**: Standardize `POSTGRES_USER` to `postgres` across all config files to prevent P1000 errors.
- **Monitoring Cleanup**: Remove non-existent targets (`node-exporter`, `cadvisor`) and placeholder credentials from `prometheus.yml` to prevent error logs.

### **2. Backup Procedures**
- **Create Backup Script**: Implement `scripts/backup.sh` to perform hot backups of:
    - Postgres Database (`pg_dump`)
    - Redis Data (`dump.rdb`)
- This fulfills the "confirm backup procedures" requirement.

### **3. Verification & Smoke Tests**
- **Database Migrations**: Execute `prisma migrate deploy` inside the container to confirm the schema is compliant.
- **Smoke Test Suite**: Create and run `scripts/smoke_test.py` to validate:
    - Core API Health & Auth
    - Frontend Availability (Terminal & Editor)
    - Celery Worker Connectivity
    - Metrics Endpoint Availability

### **4. Security Audit & Final Report**
- **Security Scan**: Run the `security-audit` skill on the hardened configuration.
- **Go-Live Documentation**: Generate `GO_LIVE_REPORT.md` containing:
    - Deployment Timestamp
    - Final Configuration Summary (redacted secrets)
    - Smoke Test Results
    - Backup Location & Instructions

**Note on SSL/CDN**: As this is a local Docker environment acting as production, I will verify the *capability* for SSL (via Nginx container) but will not provision actual certificates (which requires a public domain).

**Ready to proceed?** Confiming this plan will execute these hardening steps and launch the system in Production Mode.
