## Additional Commitment

In the spirit of HyperCode's mission, we commit to:

- **Accessibility**: This software is designed with accessibility in mind.
  We strive to ensure it's usable by people of all abilities, including
  those with disabilities or neurodivergence.

- **Neurodivergent-First Design**: HyperCode prioritizes the needs of
  neurodivergent developers (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and others) in its
  design and development practices.

- **Openness**: We welcome contributions, feedback, and community participation.
  No gatekeeping, no corporate capture.

- **Ethical Use**: While MIT-licensed, we encourage users to consider the
  ethical implications of how they use HyperCode, particularly regarding
  accessibility and inclusion.
