# 📜 Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

HyperCode is built on the principle that **all minds matter**. We are committed to
providing a **welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free** community for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, neurodivergence, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
sexual identity, or sexual orientation.

**This Code of Conduct applies to all HyperCode spaces**: GitHub issues, discussions,
pull requests, social media, community events, and any other channels where HyperCode
community members interact.

## 🛡️ Commitment to Neurodivergent Inclusion

people often face barriers in tech communities. Therefore:

- **We don't penalize neurodivergent behaviors** like stimming, asking for clarification
  multiple times, or taking breaks
- **We adapt our communication** to different processing styles (written, visual,
  detailed, simplified)
- **We believe in access needs** and provide accommodations when requested
- **We recognize that productivity looks different for different brains** and don't
  impose arbitrary deadlines
- **We welcome "weird" ideas**—they often lead to innovation
