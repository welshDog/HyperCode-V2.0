## Context
What is the issue we're facing? What problem needs solving?

Include:
- Current state
- Pain points
- Constraints (technical, community, accessibility)
- Why this decision is needed now

## Decision
We will [clear, specific statement of what we're doing].

Example: "We will use word-based keywords instead of symbols for control flow structures (e.g., `when` instead of `if`, `iterate` instead of `for`)."

## Rationale
Why this decision over alternatives?

Link to supporting evidence:
- Research showing cognitive load benefits
- User feedback from studies
- Comparative analysis of other languages
- Accessibility requirements

## Consequences

### Positive
- Benefit 1: Explanation
- Benefit 2: Explanation

### Negative
- Trade-off 1: What we give up
- Trade-off 2: Challenges introduced

### Neutral
- Side effect 1: Things to monitor
- Side effect 2: Indirect impacts

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- **Description:** What it was
- **Pros:** Benefits
- **Cons:** Why rejected
- **Research:** [[link-to-analysis]]

### Alternative 2: [Name]
- **Description:** What it was
- **Pros:** Benefits
- **Cons:** Why rejected

## Relations

### Depends On
- [[research-note-id]] - Research providing evidence
- [[other-decision-id]] - Prior decision this builds on

### Supports
- [[downstream-decision-id]] - Future decisions this enables

### Related To
- [[related-decision-id]] - Related but independent decision

## Implementation Notes

### Syntax Changes
```hypercode
// Example code showing the decision in action
when condition:
    do_something()
```

### Compiler Impact
- Changes needed in parser
- Type system implications
- Performance considerations

### Migration Path
For existing HyperCode code (if any):
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

### Documentation Updates
- Tutorial changes needed
- API docs to update
- Examples to revise

## Review History
- YYYY-MM-DD: Proposed by @username - rationale
- YYYY-MM-DD: Community feedback period opened
- YYYY-MM-DD: Revised based on feedback
- YYYY-MM-DD: Adopted by core team

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement in compiler
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Write migration guide
- [ ] Announce to community

## Template 3: experiment.md

```markdown

type: experiment
title: "[Experiment Name]"
id: exp-xxx-kebab-case
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft | in_progress | completed | reviewed
tags: [experiment, usability_test, tag1, tag2]
hypothesis: "Brief clear statement of what you're testing"
participants: N  # Number of participants
methodology: usability_test | AB_test | pilot | prototype | survey | interview
result: success | partial | failed | inconclusive | pending
---

## Hypothesis
**Clear statement:** "We believe that [change X] will result in [outcome Y] because [reason Z]."

Example: "We believe that word-based syntax will reduce task completion time by 20% for ADHD developers because it reduces working memory load when reading code."

## Methodology

### Participants
- **N:** Number of participants
- **Recruitment:** How were they found?
- **Demographics:** 
  - Neurodivergent profiles (ADHD, autism, etc.)
  - Programming experience levels
  - Age range (if relevant)
- **Compensation:** How were participants compensated?

### Protocol
1. **Setup:** Environment, tools, initial briefing
2. **Tasks:** 
   - Task 1: Description, expected time
   - Task 2: Description, expected time
   - Task 3: Description, expected time
3. **Data Collection:**
   - Metrics tracked (time, errors, success rate)
   - Observation methods (think-aloud, screen recording)
   - Post-task surveys or interviews
4. **Duration:** Total time per participant

### Materials
- Code samples used
- Task descriptions
- Survey questions
- Interview guide

Link to materials: `experiments/pilots/exp-xxx/materials/`

### Analysis Plan
How will results be evaluated?
- Statistical tests (if quantitative)
- Coding scheme (if qualitative)
- Success criteria

## Results

### Quantitative

| Metric | Symbol-Based | Word-Based | Difference | p-value |
|--------|--------------|------------|------------|---------|
| Avg completion time | 12.3 min | 9.7 min | -21% | p<0.05 |
| Error rate | 18% | 11% | -39% | p<0.03 |
| Success rate | 75% | 92% | +23% | p<0.02 |

### Qualitative

**Theme 1: Readability**
- Quote: "I could scan the code without re-reading lines" (P4, ADHD)
- Quote: "The words felt more natural than remembering symbols" (P7, autism)

**Theme 2: Cognitive Load**
- Quote: "I didn't have to keep translating symbols in my head" (P2, ADHD)

**Theme 3: Error Recovery**
- Quote: "When I made a mistake, the error message made more sense with words" (P9)

**Observations:**
- Participants with ADHD showed 30% fewer context switches
- Autistic participants appreciated consistency in word usage

## Analysis

### What We Learned
Key takeaways from the data:
1. **Finding 1:** Explanation with evidence
2. **Finding 2:** Explanation with evidence
3. **Finding 3:** Explanation with evidence

### Surprises
Unexpected results that warrant further investigation:
- Observation 1
- Observation 2

### Limitations
- Sample size: Limited to 12 participants
- Diversity: Need more representation of [group]
- Methodology: [potential bias or constraint]
- Generalizability: Results may not apply to [context]

## Implications
