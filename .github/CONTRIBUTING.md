# 🤝 Contributing to HyperCode

Welcome to the HyperCode team! We're building a tool that helps developers stay in flow, and we want your help.

## 🧠 Our Philosophy: Neurodiversity First

We believe in:
- **Clarity over Brevity**: Explain *why*, not just *what*.
- **Explicit Instructions**: No "implied" requirements.
- **Psychological Safety**: It's okay to ask "stupid" questions. There are no stupid questions here.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### 1. Found a Bug?
- Open an Issue on GitHub.
- Describe what happened, what you expected, and steps to reproduce.
- Screenshots or error logs are super helpful!

### 2. Want to Build a Feature?
- Check the **Roadmap** in `README.md` (or open a discussion).
- Fork the repository.
- Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"`
- Push to your branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
- Open a Pull Request.
