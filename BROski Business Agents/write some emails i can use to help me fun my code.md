### 1. Mozilla Foundation

Subject: Grant Application: AI Tools for Neurodivergent Accessibility

Dear Mozilla Foundation Team,

My name is Lyndon "Welshdog" Williams. I'm applying for funding to expand Hyperfocus Zone—a platform of AI-driven support systems for neurodivergent individuals.

Eight years ago, I transitioned from carpentry to coding, navigating dyslexia and autism with AI as my guide. I taught myself 3D printing, built a Web3 shop, and created tools that help people like me thrive daily.

**What I'm building:**
- AI-powered assistive tools for neurodivergent minds
- Open-source support systems
- Educational resources that make coding accessible

**The funding would cover:**
- Development time to build and refine tools
- Server costs and infrastructure
- Documentation and community support

This aligns with Mozilla's mission for a more inclusive internet. I'd love to discuss how we can work together.

If you can dream it, you can build it—Hyperfocus it.

Best regards,

Subject: Funding Request: Tech Tools Supporting Autistic Independence

Dear Autistica Team,

My name is Lyndon "Welshdog" Williams, based in Wales. I'm reaching out for funding support to dedicate more time to Hyperfocus Zone—AI tools designed to support autistic and neurodivergent individuals.

As someone with autism and dyslexia, I've used AI to transform from a tradesperson into a developer. Now I want to share those tools with others who face similar barriers.

**Current projects include:**
- Daily support systems for executive function challenges
- AI assistants that break down complex tasks
- Tools that make coding and learning accessible

**I'm seeking funding for:**
- Full-time development (currently working part-time on this)
- Testing and user feedback sessions
- Making all tools free and open-source

Your support would help me reach more people who need these tools. Can we discuss funding opportunities?

If you can dream it, you can build it—Hyperfocus it.

Best regards,  
Lyndon "Welshdog" Williams
