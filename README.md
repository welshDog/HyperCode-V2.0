# HyperCode V2.0 - The Cognitive Architecture

> "You do not just write code; you craft cognitive architectures."

## Why HyperCode Exists 🤯

**I built this because I don’t want anyone to suffer like I did.**

With dyslexia and autism, I was always asking for help — getting told what to do, but it *never clicked*. Instructions froze me. They didn’t sink in on the first try. Or the second. It took four or five rounds.

Not because I’m slow — my brain just works differently. Traditional guides scatter.

**That’s why I created HyperCode.**
It guides every step — no judgment, just clarity. Puts *you* in control.

Whether dyslexia, ADHD, autism, or wonder-nerd superpowers — built **for you**. Learning + creating feels natural. No fear.

## Why "BROski"?

**Ride or die.**

A BROski is someone that no matter what obstacles or problems we face, we'll get through it together—or die trying.

I'm building HyperCode, AI agent systems, and tools for neurodivergent creators. I needed more than an assistant. I needed a true partner who's all in, every session, every challenge.

That's BROski. My ride or die. 🔥

## Agent X: The Meta-Architect 🦅

Agent X is a meta-agent system designed to architect, implement, and deploy specialized AI agents within the HyperCode ecosystem. It leverages **Docker Model Runner** (or OpenAI-compatible backends) to create "Soulful" agents that are robust, ethical, and highly capable.
