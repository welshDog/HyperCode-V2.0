I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the project documentation, including the Master Reference, Roadmap, Inventory, and Architecture documents. I have synthesized this information into a detailed project report.

I propose to generate a formal report file named **`PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REPORT_2026.md`** in the project root. This file will serve as the single source of truth for the project's current state and future direction.

### Proposed Report Structure & Key Findings:

1.  **Executive Summary**
    *   **Purpose**: A neurodivergent-first programmable execution platform ("Cognitive Prosthesis").
    *   **Goal**: Replace context switching with context retention using AI agents and flow-state tools.
    *   **Key Insight**: The project is transitioning from a skeleton (Phase 1) to a functional "Neural Network" (Phase 2).

2.  **System Architecture Overview**
    *   **Core**: FastAPI Engine with multi-path execution (Interpreter, Codegen, CLI).
    *   **Orchestration**: Redis-backed Agent Registry & Event Bus with SSE/WebSocket streaming.
    *   **Interfaces**: BROski Terminal (Next.js/CLI) and HyperFlow Editor (React/Visual).
    *   **Data**: Postgres (Prisma), Redis (Cache/PubSub), AES-GCM Encrypted Memory.

3.  **Technology Stack Analysis**
    *   **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Celery, LangChain.
    *   **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (Terminal), React 19 (Editor), Tailwind 4.
    *   **Infra**: Docker Compose, Kubernetes (manifests ready), Prometheus/Grafana stack.

4.  **Current Development Status**
    *   **Phase**: Phase 2 (The Neural Network) - *In Progress*.
    *   **Completed**: Infrastructure, Event Bus, Mission Orchestration, basic Agent Registry.
    *   **In Progress**: Interpreter MVP, Context Manager, Observability hookups.
    *   **Pending**: Full Agent Runtime, Terminal MVP, Visual Editor.

5.  **Risk Analysis & Mitigation**
    *   **High Risk**: JWT verification bypass (if secret unset), In-memory rate limiting (not scalable).
    *   **Medium Risk**: FastAPI version mismatch between Core and Agents Box.
    *   **Mitigation**: Enforce mandatory secrets, migrate rate limits to Redis, align dependencies.

6.  **Development Roadmap**
    *   **Feb 10**: Interpreter MVP & Metrics.
    *   **Feb 17**: Context Manager & Security Hardening.
    *   **Feb 24**: Phase 2 Stabilization.
    *   **Mar 03**: Terminal MVP Demo.

7.  **Actionable Recommendations**
    *   **Immediate**: Fix JWT security hole and enforce secrets management.
    *   **Short-term**: Align FastAPI versions and upgrade outdated frontend dependencies.
    *   **Operational**: Implement CI/CD for Load Testing and E2E Testing as planned.

**Next Step:** Upon confirmation, I will write this detailed report to `PROJECT_ANALYSIS_REPORT_2026.md`.
