I have verified that the optimized configuration is already present at both the source (`Downloads\HyperCode-V2.0\.wslconfig`) and the destination (`%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`).

### **Execution Plan**

1.  **Cleanup**:
    *   Delete the redundant source file: `c:\Users\Lyndz\Downloads\HyperCode-V2.0\.wslconfig`.
2.  **Apply Configuration**:
    *   Execute `wsl --shutdown` to force a restart of the WSL subsystem, ensuring the new settings in `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig` take effect.
3.  **Validation**:
    *   Verify the WSL service restarts successfully.
    *   (Optional) Check active WSL distributions.

This completes the migration as requested, leaving only the active configuration file in the correct system path.
