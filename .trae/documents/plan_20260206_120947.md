I have moved the evaluation review file to `docs/health-reports/TECHNICAL_EVALUATION_REVIEW_2026-02-06.md`.

Based on the review's recommendations, I have a plan to implement the critical improvements:

**1. Immediate Actions (Today's Focus):**
*   **Fix Startup Race Condition:** Update `docker-compose.yml` to make all agents depend on `hypercode-core` being *healthy*, not just *started*. This is the #1 recommended stability fix.
*   **Add Resource Limits:** Implement CPU/Memory limits in `docker-compose.yml` to prevent noisy neighbors (e.g., prioritize `hypercode-llama` and `orchestrator`).
*   **Idempotency Test:** Verify the registry's duplicate handling (as requested in the previous turn).

**2. Short-Term Actions (This Week):**
*   **Agent Wake/Sleep:** I will research and plan the implementation of the "Reactive Scaling" pattern for the Orchestrator to save resources.
*   **Database Locking:** I will draft the SQL migration to add `UNIQUE` constraints to the agent registry table.

**3. Documentation:**
*   Create `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` to document current permissions and the planned gVisor integration.

**Verification:**
*   After applying the docker-compose changes, I will restart the stack and verify that agents wait for the core API to be fully ready before crashing/restarting.

Shall I proceed with applying the `docker-compose.yml` updates for health dependencies and resource limits?
