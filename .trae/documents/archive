I have assessed the current deployment readiness state based on the existing `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md` (dated 2026-02-02) and the recent changes I implemented (Llama integration).

**Current Status:**
*   **Baseline:** The system was marked "READY" on Feb 2nd.
*   **Delta:** The new **Local AI / LLM Module** has been added but *not yet formally audited* for production readiness.
*   **Gaps:**
    *   **Security:** New endpoints (`/llm/generate`) need a security review.
    *   **Rollback:** No formal rollback procedure exists in the documentation.
    *   **Documentation:** `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md` is outdated (missing AI module).

**Execution Plan:**

1.  **Targeted Security Audit:**
    *   Audit `app/services/llm_service.py` and `app/routers/orchestrator.py` for potential DoS vectors (e.g., large prompts) and input validation.

2.  **Infrastructure Verification:**
    *   Verify `docker-compose.core.yml` resource limits for the `llama` service to ensure it doesn't starve the Core API in production.

3.  **Create Rollback Procedure:**
    *   Author `docs/ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE.md` detailing how to revert Docker tags and database migrations in case of a failed deploy.

4.  **Update Deployment Documentation:**
    *   Update `DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md` to include the "AI Module" validation status.

5.  **Final Go-Live Report:**
    *   Generate a summary confirming the system is ready for the "Soft Launch".

I will proceed with these steps immediately to finalize production readiness.
