I have verified the project organization status and performed the system health check as requested.

**Findings:**
1.  **Project Organization:**
    *   The file structure aligns with `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md`.
    *   `notes/`, `docs/health-reports/`, `docs/archive/`, and `docs/plans/` contain the expected moved files.
    *   **Git Status:** There are numerous file moves (renames) and new files staged for commit, matching the "Cleaned and Organized" status.

2.  **System Health Check:**
    *   **Docker:** All 17 containers are currently **STOPPED** (Exited). This includes core services, agents, and databases.
    *   **GitHub:** The repository `welshDog/HyperCode-V2.0` is accessible (HTTP 200 OK).
    *   **Resources:** Docker Desktop is running (2 CPUs, 1.86GB RAM available).

**Plan:**
1.  **Commit the Cleanup:** Finalize the project organization by committing the staged file moves.
    *   *Message:* `chore: organize project structure and clean up root directory`
2.  **Restart Services:** Bring the system back online since all containers are stopped.
    *   *Command:* `docker-compose up -d`
3.  **Verify Health:** Check container status again after restart to ensuring all services are `healthy` or `running`.

Please confirm if you want to proceed with committing the cleanup and restarting the services.
