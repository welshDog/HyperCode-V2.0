# HyperCode: The Neurodivergent-First, AI-Native Orchestration Language

## What is HyperCode
HyperCode is a programming language and orchestration platform designed for flow-state work. It aligns tasks, agents, and context so developers—especially neurodivergent devs—can build without losing the thread.

## Why Neurodivergent-First
- Context retention over context switching
- Clear start/finish signals for missions
- Visual-first mental models (graphs, timelines)
- Respect for different processing styles: concise + explicit

## Why AI-Native
- Agents as first-class participants
- Observable, auditable workflows
- Cost/time metrics built in
- Seamless human-in-the-loop checkpoints

## Esoteric Roots Matter
HyperCode embraces IRs, interpreters, and multi-target compilation. The point isn’t obscurity—it’s flexibility: one orchestration language, many execution backends.

## Core Promises
- Missions, not miscellaneous tasks
- Agents with accountability (health, load, audit)
- Observability from day one (metrics, traces)
- Auth + RBAC that stays out of your way in dev, locks down in prod

## What You Can Build Today
- Mission-driven flows: create → assign → start → verify → complete
- Agent registries and capability-aware dispatch
- Visual dashboards: timelines, status, metrics

## The Movement
HyperCode is open source and community-driven. It’s for anyone who’s ever felt lost in the tabs, or needed stronger scaffolding to keep the work coherent. Bring your modes of thinking—we’ll meet you there.
