## **The Future of Autonomous Coding Has Arrived.**

We are proud to announce the immediate availability of **HyperCode V2.0**, the world's first **Neurodivergent-First, AI-Native Development Platform**.

This release marks a paradigm shift in how software is built. We aren't just shipping an IDE; we are shipping a **Crew**.

### 🌟 Key Features

#### 1. **The Hyper Agent Crew 🤖**
A swarm of 8 specialized AI agents working in perfect synchronization:
*   **Frontend Specialist**: React/Next.js expert.
*   **Backend Specialist**: API & Database architect.
*   **QA Engineer**: Automated testing & validation.
*   **DevOps Engineer**: Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD.
*   **Security Engineer**: Vulnerability scanning & hardening.
*   **System Architect**: High-level design & patterns.
*   **Project Strategist**: Roadmap & milestone management.
*   **Crew Orchestrator**: The conductor ensuring harmony.

#### 2. **Mission Control 🎮**
Stop writing JIRA tickets. Start launching **Missions**.
Describe your goal ("Build a login page"), and the Orchestrator breaks it down, assigns it to the right agents, and executes it.

#### 3. **Local AI Privacy 🔒**
Powered by **Ollama**, your code never leaves your machine unless you want it to.
*   **Zero API Costs** for local development.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Privacy** by default.

#### 4. **Hyperfocus Workspace 🧠**
Designed for the neurodivergent mind:
*   **Clutter-Free UI**: Only what you need, when you need it.
*   **Flow State Triggers**: Ambient audio & visual cues.
*   **Context Preservation**: The AI remembers so you don't have to.
