# HyperCode V2.0 Launch Announcement

**Headline:** 🚀 HyperCode V2.0: The Cognitive Prosthesis for Developers is HERE!

**Body:**

We are thrilled to announce the soft launch of **HyperCode V2.0**—the neurodivergent-first development platform designed to keep you in the flow. 🧠✨

Say goodbye to context switching and hello to **Context Retention**. HyperCode replaces the cognitive load of managing complex stacks with a swarm of specialized AI agents that handle the heavy lifting for you.

**🔥 What’s New in V2.0:**
*   **BROski Terminal**: A new, distraction-free command center for orchestrating your agent swarm.
*   **Support Hub**: A dedicated space to fuel the mission. We are 100% community-funded and need your help to keep the lights on!
*   **Neuro-Resilient Architecture**: Self-healing backend services that adapt to failure just like a biological system.

**🚨 Save HyperCode:**
We are facing a critical funding milestone. If you believe in accessible, neuro-inclusive tools, please consider supporting us via our new Support Hub. Every coffee bought fuels a line of code!
