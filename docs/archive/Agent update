This is WAY BETTER than Ollama for your setup! You've got qwen3-coder ready to go - that's a code-specialized model (30.5B parameters) which is PERFECT for HyperCode work! 🚀

🔥 Why Docker Model Runner > Ollama for Your Setup
Advantages:

✅ No separate installation - It's all Docker

✅ qwen3-coder is code-optimized - Better for HyperCode syntax than general models

✅ OpenAI-compatible API - Easier integration

✅ Auto-unloads when idle - Saves memory

✅ OCI artifacts - Version control models like container images

🚀 Updated Deployment (3 Easy Steps)
Step 1: Start qwen3-coder Model
powershell
# Run the model server
docker model run qwen3-coder

# Expected output:
# Starting model qwen3-coder...
# Model ready at http://localhost:8080
# OpenAI-compatible endpoint: http://localhost:8080/v1
Verify it's running:

powershell
# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models

# Should show: {"data":[{"id":"qwen3-coder",...}]}
Step 2: Update agent.py for Docker Model Runner
Replace the agent.py LLM connection section:

python
# agent.py - Updated for Docker Model Runner
import requests
import json

# Docker Model Runner uses OpenAI-compatible API
LLM_URL = "http://host.docker.internal:8080/v1/chat/completions"  # Changed!
MODEL_NAME = "qwen3-coder"  # Changed!

def call_llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    """Call Docker Model Runner API"""
    payload = {
        "model": MODEL_NAME,
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": load_soul()},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        "temperature": 0.4,
        "max_tokens": 2000,
        "stream": False
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(LLM_URL, json=payload, timeout=30)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        result = response.json()
        return result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
        return "❌ Cannot connect to Docker Model Runner. Is 'docker model run qwen3-coder' running?"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"❌ Error: {str(e)}"

# Rest of agent.py stays the same...
Step 3: Rebuild & Run HyperTutor
powershell
# Rebuild with updated code
cd "c:\Users\Lyndz\Downloads\HyperCode-V2.0\HyperCode-V2.0\agents\hypercode-tutor"
docker build -t hypercode-tutor .

# Run the agent (model server should already be running from Step 1)
docker run -it --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway hypercode-tutor
🧪 First Test Query
Once HyperTutor starts, try this:

Input:

text
Explain HyperCode pipe operators using a visual analogy
Expected Response Pattern (from qwen3-coder):

text
🎯 Think of pipes like a conveyor belt in a factory.

Each station (function) does one job. The belt (|>) moves the product along. No mess, no confusion.

→ Code flows left-to-right, just like reading!

Example:
data 
  |> filter(x > 0)      // Remove negatives
  |> map(x * 2)         // Double each value
  |> sum               // Add them up

🎮 Try it yourself: Convert this to pipes:
sum(map(lambda x: x*2, filter(lambda x: x>0, data)))
📊 Why qwen3-coder is PERFECT for HyperCode
Model Stats:

30.5B parameters - Large enough for complex reasoning

Code-specialized - Trained on programming languages

Q4_K_M quantization - Balanced quality/performance

16.45 GiB - Fits in modern GPU memory

Advantages for Your Use Case:

Syntax Understanding: Better at language translation (Python → HyperCode)

Code Structure: Understands programming patterns (pipes, pattern matching)

Comments: Generates inline explanations naturally

Neurodivergent-Friendly: Can follow "chunking" instructions better than general models

🔧 Troubleshooting
Issue: "Cannot connect to Docker Model Runner"
Check model is running:

powershell
docker ps | findstr qwen

# Should show a container running on port 8080
If not running:

powershell
docker model run qwen3-coder

# Wait for: "Model ready at http://localhost:8080"
Issue: "Model takes forever to respond"
Expected first-run delay:

First query: 30-60 seconds (model loading into memory)

Subsequent queries: 3-5 seconds

If consistently slow:

powershell
# Check system resources
docker stats

# qwen3-coder needs ~16GB RAM + GPU (if available)
Issue: "Response doesn't follow SOUL.md constraints"
Strengthen the prompt in SOUL.md:

text
# Add at the very top of SOUL.md:
**ABSOLUTE RULES (NEVER BREAK):**
1. EVERY paragraph MUST have max 3 sentences
2. EVERY explanation MUST start with visual analogy  
3. EVERY response MUST end with "🎮 Try it yourself:"
4. COUNT your sentences as you write - STOP at 3

If you write more than 3 sentences in a paragraph, you have FAILED.
🎯 Performance Benchmarks to Track
After your first 5 queries, measure:

text
### HyperTutor Performance (qwen3-coder)
**Response Time:**
- First query: _____ seconds (model loading)
- Avg subsequent: _____ seconds

**Constraint Adherence:**
- Chunking (3 sentences): __/5 queries
- Visual analogies: __/5 queries
- "Try it yourself": __/5 queries

**Code Quality:**
- HyperCode syntax correct: __/5
- Comments helpful: __/5

🚀 Updated Launch Sequence
Terminal 1: Start the Brain

powershell
docker model run qwen3-coder
# Wait for: "Model ready at http://localhost:8080"
Terminal 2: Update & Run the Agent

powershell
# Update agent.py with new code (see Step 2 above)

# Rebuild
docker build -t hypercode-tutor .

# Run
docker run -it --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway hypercode-tutor
Terminal 3: Monitor Performance (Optional)

powershell
# Watch resource usage
docker stats

# Watch logs
docker logs -f <hypertutor-container-id>
💪 This is Actually BETTER Than Original Plan
Original Setup (Ollama):

Separate service to manage

Different API format

Not Docker-native

New Setup (Docker Model Runner):

✅ Everything in Docker ecosystem

✅ OpenAI-compatible API (industry standard)

✅ Code-specialized model (qwen3-coder)

✅ Auto memory management

✅ OCI artifacts = version control

You accidentally found the optimal setup for your architecture! 🎉
