## 🚀 4-Phase Implementation

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
**Goal:** Set up infrastructure without disrupting existing development.

#### Tasks:
1. **Create Research DB Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/research_db/{_templates,research,design_decisions,experiments,user_studies}
   mkdir -p docs/research_db/research/{cognitive_science,accessibility,neurodivergent_ux,language_comparisons}
   ```

2. **Install Schema & Templates**
   - Copy `_schema.md` to `docs/research_db/`
   - Copy templates to `docs/research_db/_templates/`
   - Add `validate_research_db.py` to repo root

3. **Test Validation**
   ```bash
   python validate_research_db.py docs/research_db/
   ```

4. **Update CI/CD**
   - Add `.github/workflows/validate-research-db.yml`
   - Configure to run on PRs touching `docs/research_db/**`

**Deliverable:** Empty but validated research database structure.

---

### **Phase 2: Retroactive Documentation (Week 2)**
**Goal:** Document existing design decisions with evidence.

#### Priority Decisions to Document:

**ADR-001: Python as Implementation Language**
- **Why:** Accessibility, rapid prototyping, strong typing via type hints
- **Research:** Python readability studies, prototyping speed data
- **Trade-off:** Performance vs accessibility

**ADR-002: HolyC Integration Philosophy**
- **Why:** Honoring Terry Davis's "forgotten genius"
- **Research:** TempleOS design principles, simplicity in OS design
- **Trade-off:** Niche inspiration vs mainstream adoption

**ADR-003: Interpreter-First Architecture**
- **Why:** Faster iteration, easier debugging for neurodivergent devs
- **Research:** REPL benefits for ADHD developers (instant feedback)
- **Trade-off:** Performance vs development velocity

**ADR-004: Docker-Based Development**
- **Why:** Reduces "works on my machine" friction
- **Research:** Cognitive load of environment setup
- **Trade-off:** Container overhead vs consistency

**ADR-005: Word-Based Syntax** (if applicable)
- **Why:** Readability for dyslexic/ADHD developers
- **Research:** Symbol density vs comprehension speed
- **Trade-off:** Verbosity vs clarity

#### Research Notes to Create:

1. **`research/cognitive_science/working-memory-adhd.md`**
   - Source: Klingberg et al. (2005) - Working memory in ADHD
   - Implication: Shallow nesting, clear variable names

2. **`research/accessibility/dyslexia-font-research.md`**
   - Source: British Dyslexia Association font guidelines
   - Implication: IDE font recommendations, syntax highlighting

3. **`research/neurodivergent_ux/repl-feedback-adhd.md`**
   - Source: Instant feedback benefits for ADHD
   - Implication: Interpreter-first design, error messages

4. **`research/language_comparisons/python-readability.md`**
   - Source: Comparative readability studies
   - Implication: Justifies Python as implementation language

5. **`research/language_comparisons/holyc-simplicity.md`**
   - Source: TempleOS documentation, design philosophy
   - Implication: Minimalist language features

**Deliverable:** 5 research notes + 5 ADRs with full traceability.

---

### **Phase 3: Current Development Documentation (Week 3)**
**Goal:** Integrate research process into ongoing development.

#### Workflow Changes:

**Before Merging New Features:**
1. Create decision document (`design_decisions/adr-XXX.md`)
2. Link to supporting research (or create research notes)
3. Include Relations section connecting to existing decisions
4. Pass validation before merge

**Example: Adding a New Syntax Feature**
```markdown
# Before: "We're adding 'when' keyword"
# After: ADR-XXX with research on keyword clarity + user study results
```

#### Update CONTRIBUTING.md:
```markdown
## Contributing to HyperCode

### For Code Changes:
1. Write code following style guide
2. Add tests
3. **Document design rationale** (if architectural change)
   - Create ADR in `docs/research_db/design_decisions/`
   - Link to supporting research
   - Run validation: `python validate_research_db.py docs/research_db/`
4. Submit PR

### For Research Contributions:
1. Copy template from `docs/research_db/_templates/`
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Link to related decisions
4. Submit PR with `[research]` prefix
```

**Deliverable:** Research workflow integrated into development process.

---

### **Phase 4: User Studies & Feedback Loop (Weeks 4-6)**
**Goal:** Begin empirical validation of design choices.

#### First User Study:

**Experiment: Syntax Preference Study**
- **Hypothesis:** Word-based syntax reduces cognitive load 20% vs symbol-heavy
- **Participants:** 10-15 neurodivergent developers (ADHD, autism, dyslexia)
- **Methodology:** A/B test with timed coding tasks
- **Document:** `experiments/usability_tests/exp-001-syntax-preference.md`

#### Feedback Collection:

**Set Up:**
1. GitHub Discussions category: "UX Feedback"
2. Survey form for neurodivergent developers
3. Interview protocol template

**Capture Insights:**
- Create research notes from user feedback
- Link feedback to decisions
- Track patterns across multiple users

**Example Flow:**
```
User reports: "Symbol operators slow me down"
    ↓
Create: user_studies/interviews/interview-005-adhd-dev.md
    ↓
Link to: adr-005-word-based-syntax
    ↓
Update decision status: "validated by user feedback"
```

**Deliverable:** First user study completed, feedback pipeline established.

## 🔗 Integration Points with Existing Code

### 1. **Interpreter Design → Research**
**Current:** `hypercode/interpreter.py`
**Research Link:** 
- ADR-003: Interpreter-first architecture
- Research: REPL feedback benefits for ADHD

**Action:** Add docstring referencing ADR:
```python
"""
HyperCode Interpreter - Interactive execution environment

Design rationale: Interpreter-first approach provides immediate feedback,
reducing cognitive load for ADHD developers by eliminating long compile cycles.

See: docs/research_db/design_decisions/adr-003-interpreter-first.md
"""
```

### 2. **Error Messages → UX Research**
**Current:** Error handling in parser
**Research Link:**
- ADR-006: Error message framework
- Research: Clear, actionable errors for neurodivergent devs

**Action:** Document error message philosophy:
```python
def syntax_error(self, token, message):
    """
    Neurodivergent-friendly error reporting.
    
    Principles:
    - Be specific (not "syntax error" but "missing 'end' keyword")
    - Show context (highlight exact location)
    - Suggest fix (if possible)
    
    See: docs/research_db/design_decisions/adr-006-error-messages.md
    """
```

### 3. **Testing Strategy → Evidence**
**Current:** pytest suite
**Research Link:**
- ADR-007: Test-driven development for reliability
- Research: Predictability reduces anxiety for neurodivergent devs

**Action:** Link test philosophy to research in `tests/README.md`

### 4. **HolyC Integration → Historical Context**
**Current:** HolyC code (18.6%)
**Research Link:**
- ADR-002: HolyC integration philosophy
- Research: TempleOS design principles

**Action:** Create `docs/research_db/research/language_comparisons/holyc-design-philosophy.md`
