- [ ] PyYAML installed: `pip install pyyaml`

---

## 🚀 Sprint Plan: 3-Day Implementation

### Day 1: Foundation (4 hours)

#### Morning: Structure Setup (2 hours)

**Task 1.1: Create Directory Structure**
```bash
cd your-hypercode-repo

# Create core directories
mkdir -p research/cognitive_science
mkdir -p research/accessibility
mkdir -p research/neurodivergent_ux
mkdir -p research/language_comparisons
mkdir -p design_decisions
mkdir -p experiments/usability_tests
mkdir -p experiments/pilots
mkdir -p user_studies/interviews
mkdir -p user_studies/surveys
mkdir -p references/papers
mkdir -p references/bibtex
mkdir -p _templates
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

**Task 1.2: Install Schema and Templates**
```bash
# Copy the schema file (from artifacts provided)
# Save as: _schema.md

# Copy templates (from artifacts provided)
# Save as: _templates/research_note.md
# Save as: _templates/decision.md
# Save as: _templates/experiment.md
```

**Task 1.3: Add Validation Script**
```bash
# Copy the validator Python script (from artifacts provided)
# Save as: validate_research_db.py

chmod +x validate_research_db.py

# Test it works
python validate_research_db.py .
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Validating HyperCode Research Database...

Found 0 files to validate

No markdown files found to validate.
```

#### Afternoon: First Content (2 hours)

**Task 1.4: Convert Existing Notes (if any)**

If you have existing research notes:
1. Pick your 3 most important notes
2. Copy `_templates/research_note.md` for each
3. Fill in metadata and content
4. Save in appropriate subdirectories

**Task 1.5: Create First Decision (Example)**

Copy and customize the example ADR-001 (from artifacts):
```bash
# Save as: design_decisions/adr-001-syntax-minimalism.md
```

Customize it based on your actual HyperCode design choices.

**Task 1.6: Validate**
```bash
python validate_research_db.py .
```

Fix any errors until validation passes.

---

### Day 2: Content Creation (4-6 hours)

#### Morning: Research Foundation (2-3 hours)

**Task 2.1: Add Core Research Notes**

Create these essential research notes (pick 5-7 most relevant):

1. **Cognitive Science**
   - `research/cognitive_science/working-memory-adhd.md`
   - `research/cognitive_science/executive-function-adhd.md`
   - `research/cognitive_science/pattern-recognition-autism.md`

2. **Accessibility**
   - `research/accessibility/visual-noise-reduction.md`
   - `research/accessibility/dyslexia-friendly-fonts.md`

3. **Language Comparisons**
   - `research/language_comparisons/python-readability-analysis.md`
   - `research/language_comparisons/rust-error-messages-analysis.md`

**Pro Tip:** Start with abstracts/summaries. You can expand later. The goal is to establish the graph structure.

**Task 2.2: Validate After Each File**
```bash
# After adding each file:
python validate_research_db.py .

# Fix any errors immediately (easier than fixing 10 files at once)
```

#### Afternoon: Decisions (2-3 hours)

**Task 2.3: Document Key Decisions**

Create 2-3 architecture decision records:

1. **ADR-001**: Core syntax philosophy (word-based vs symbols)
2. **ADR-002**: Error message framework
3. **ADR-003**: Type system approach OR nesting limits

For each:
1. Copy `_templates/decision.md`
2. Fill out Context, Decision, Rationale
3. Link to at least 2 research notes in Relations section
4. Include code examples

**Task 2.4: Link Research ↔ Decisions**

Go back to research notes and add Relations links:
```markdown
## Relations

### Supports
- [[adr-001-syntax-minimalism]] - Provides evidence for this decision
- [[adr-003-nesting-limits]] - Informs this design choice
```

**Task 2.5: Validate Complete System**
```bash
python validate_research_db.py .
```

You should now have:
- ✅ 5-7 research notes
- ✅ 2-3 design decisions
- ✅ Bidirectional links between them
- ✅ Zero validation errors

---

### Day 3: Automation & Polish (3-4 hours)

#### Morning: CI/CD Setup (1-2 hours)

**Task 3.1: GitHub Actions Workflow**
```bash
# Copy workflow file (from artifacts provided)
# Save as: .github/workflows/validate-research-db.yml
```

**Task 3.2: Markdown Link Check Config**
```bash
# Create: .github/markdown-link-check-config.json
```

```json
{
  "ignorePatterns": [
    {
      "pattern": "^https://doi.org"
    }
  ],
  "timeout": "20s",
  "retryOn429": true,
  "retryCount": 3,
  "fallbackRetryDelay": "30s"
}
```

**Task 3.3: Test CI Locally**
```bash
# Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add HyperCode Research Database foundation"

# Push to a test branch
git checkout -b research-db-foundation
git push origin research-db-foundation

# Open PR and watch CI run
```

#### Afternoon: Documentation & Launch (1-2 hours)

**Task 3.4: Update Main README**

Add section to your main `README.md`:

```markdown
## 📚 Research Database

HyperCode's design is evidence-based. Every language decision is traced back to research, user studies, and community feedback.

**Browse the knowledge graph:**
- [Research Notes](research/) - Cognitive science, accessibility, UX research
- [Design Decisions](design_decisions/) - Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [Experiments](experiments/) - Usability tests and pilots

**Contributing Research:**
1. Copy a template from `_templates/`
2. Fill in metadata and content
3. Link to related files using `[[wiki-style]]` links
4. Submit PR with `[research]` prefix

See [_schema.md](_schema.md) for full documentation.
```

**Task 3.5: Create CONTRIBUTING.md**

```markdown
# Contributing to HyperCode Research

## Adding Research Notes

1. Choose the appropriate template from `_templates/`
2. Save in the correct subdirectory:
   - `research/` for studies, papers, analyses
   - `design_decisions/` for ADRs
   - `experiments/` for usability tests, pilots
3. Fill all required YAML fields
4. Write the `## Relations` section
5. Run validation: `python validate_research_db.py .`
6. Submit PR with `[research]` prefix

## Quality Standards

- Research notes must cite sources
- Decisions must link to ≥2 research notes
- All files must have `## Relations` section
- Use `[[wiki-links]]` for internal references

Validation runs automatically in CI.
```

**Task 3.6: Announce Launch**

Post in your community channels:

```markdown
🎉 **HyperCode Research Database is Live!**

Every design decision in HyperCode is now traced back to evidence:
- 7 research notes covering cognitive science & accessibility
- 3 architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Full docs-as-code workflow with CI validation

**Why this matters:**
- Transparent decision-making
- Evidence-based design
- Easy for contributors to understand "why"
- Git-native knowledge management

## 🎨 Optional Enhancements (Post-Sprint)

### Week 2: Visual Knowledge Graph

**Setup Obsidian for Local Viewing:**
1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
2. Open your repo as a vault
3. Enable Graph View
4. Customize colors for different note types

**Alternative: Generate Static Graph**
```bash
# Use markdown-notes-tree or similar
npm install -g markdown-notes-tree
markdown-notes-tree . --output graph.html
```

### Week 3: User Studies

Start collecting real data:
1. Create experiment protocol template
2. Recruit 5-10 neurodivergent developers
3. Run syntax preference test
4. Document in `experiments/usability_tests/exp-001-syntax-preference.md`

### Week 4: Community Templates

Create specialized templates:
- `_templates/glossary.md` - For terminology
- `_templates/interview.md` - For user interviews
- `_templates/comparative_analysis.md` - For language comparisons

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

After Sprint completion, you should have:

**Structure:**
- ✅ 4+ directories organized by type
- ✅ Schema document frozen
- ✅ 3 templates ready to use
- ✅ CI validation running

**Content:**
- ✅ 5-7 research notes
- ✅ 2-3 design decisions
- ✅ 10+ internal links between documents
- ✅ All files pass validation

**Process:**
- ✅ Validation script works locally
- ✅ GitHub Actions runs on PRs
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md explains workflow
- ✅ README links to research

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Validation failing with YAML errors"
**Fix:** Check indentation (use spaces, not tabs). Ensure closing `---` exists.

### "Missing Relations section"
**Fix:** Every file must have `## Relations` heading, even if empty:
```markdown
## Relations
None yet - foundational document.
```

### "Broken links [[file-not-found]]"
**Fix:** Either:
1. Create the missing file, or
2. Remove the link temporarily

### "CI not triggering"
**Fix:** Check `.github/workflows/` path is correct. Push to a branch and open PR.

## ✨ The Big Picture

This research database is more than documentation—it's the **institutional memory** of HyperCode. As the project grows:

- New contributors can understand **why** decisions were made
- Design debates can reference **evidence**, not opinions
- User feedback gets **systematically incorporated**
- The language evolves based on **data**, not guesses

You're not just building a language. You're building a **methodology** for neurodivergent-first design that others can learn from.

**Let's do this! 🚀**
