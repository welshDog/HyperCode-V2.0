# For Users: How HyperCode Works for You

**You never leave your editor. That's the magic.** 🪄

HyperCode is designed to be an invisible, intelligent layer that wraps around your workflow. You don't manage agents; you just work, and they amplify you.

## 🚀 The "Intent-to-Execution" Flow

When you type a command like `BROski, refactor this function to be more readable` into the terminal, here is what happens instantly behind the scenes:

### 1. 🧠 CORTEX (The Brain)
*   **What it does:** Reads your mind (almost).
*   **How:** It analyzes your fuzzy request ("make it better") and translates it into a precise technical spec ("Refactor `auth.py` using Strategy Pattern, add docstrings, reduce cyclomatic complexity").
*   **Why:** You don't have to be perfect. Cortex figures it out.

### 2. ❤️ PULSE (The Guardian)
*   **What it does:** Checks your battery.
*   **How:** It monitors your typing rhythm and session length. If you're in **Flow State**, it blocks low-priority alerts. If you're fatigued, it suggests simpler tasks or a break.
*   **Why:** To prevent burnout before it happens.

### 3. 🕸️ WEAVER (The Memory)
*   **What it does:** Connects the dots.
*   **How:** It pulls relevant context from your *entire history*. "Oh, you're refactoring auth? Here's the `User` model you changed 3 days ago and the security docs you read last week."
*   **Why:** So you don't have to search for files.

### 4. 🏛️ PANTHEON (The Builders)
*   **What it does:** The heavy lifting.
*   **How:** Specialized agents swarm the problem:
    *   **CORE Agent** writes the backend logic.
    *   **PIXEL Agent** updates the UI.
    *   **TESTER Agent** verifies nothing broke.
*   **Why:** Parallel processing. One command, three experts working at once.

### 5. 🌉 BRIDGE (The Translator)
*   **What it does:** Speaks your language.
*   **How:** It takes the complex technical output from Pantheon and reformats it into **your** preferred style (Visual diagrams? Bullet points? Metaphors?).
*   **Why:** Cognitive ease. You get exactly the info you need, how you need it.

## ⚡ Examples

### "Fix this bug"
1.  **Cortex** identifies the error from logs.
2.  **Weaver** finds the code that caused it.
3.  **Tester** writes a failing test case.
4.  **Core** fixes the code.
5.  **Bridge** tells you: "Fixed the null pointer in `login()`. 2 tests passed."

### "Explain this codebase"
1.  **Cortex** sees you're exploring.
2.  **Weaver** builds a mental map of the project.
3.  **Bridge** draws a visual graph of how modules connect.

## 🌟 The Neurodivergent Advantage

This isn't just "AI". It's an **Adaptive Cognitive Exoskeleton**.

*   **ADHD:** Flow state protection (Pulse) + Context retention (Weaver).
*   **Dyslexia:** Visual-first communication (Bridge).
*   **Autism:** Explicit, structured intent parsing (Cortex).

**HyperCode doesn't just write code. It thinks *with* you.**
